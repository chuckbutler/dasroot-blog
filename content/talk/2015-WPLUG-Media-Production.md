title: Amateur Media Production on Linux
video: null
---

Its a common misconception that Linux is not robust enough to be a full fledged
media editing machine. I've spent quite a while sifting through the tools and
putting together an amateur studio. I'll be sharing my insight into the
software, hardware, and services that will expedite your endeavors to be a
content creator on the Linux Desktop.

We will be covering audio production, distribution, and the hardware to get you
started with your own in-house audio workshop. We will also briefly touch the
subject of Video content production, and distribution mediums as well.
