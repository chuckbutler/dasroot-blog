Most of you have automated your deployments. But how does it stand up to the bus
 factor? How reusable is your automation solution? Do you find yourself wrestling
  more with the annoyances of scaling than deploying your actual services?

Service orchestration is now the easiest, most flexible, and most approachable
solution to shipping your infrastructure woes to /dev/null. Starting with
Ubuntuâ€™s 14.04 LTS release, our suite of devops tools are baked right into the
base Ubuntu Server installation.

In this session, we'll quickly go over the basic concepts of Juju and spend the
rest of the time walking through explicit examples of Juju in action. We'll look
at stacks of services managed by Juju and the charms behind those services.

We'll talk about how to get you up and running quickly with multi-sharded
MongoDB clusters, Hadoop, Cassandra, and more in just a few commands. All ready
to be deployed and reused to meet your needs.
