Building a community around juju involves traversing many firewalls,
infrastructure barriers, and false positives. To gain deeper insight into our
user adoption without going into an opt-in/opt-out model we have been evaluating
some of our base machine metrics to find key performance indicators about our
community. As we look to 2015 with these metrics, we're finding finer grained
data points to drill down and derive more insights out of existing data and
newer points to define success.
