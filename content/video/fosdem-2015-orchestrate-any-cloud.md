title: FOSDEM 2015 - orchestrate any cloud

This was my talk given at FOSDEM2015 in the ConfigManagement room. Lots of great
questions and material covering what juju is, where it sits in the ecosystem
of infrastructure tooling, and how it can supercharge your organization into
orchestrating your services, leveraging any language.

The slides for this talk are posted [on speakerdeck](https://speakerdeck.com/chuckbutler/service-orchestration-with-juju)
