Juju on Digital Ocean, WOW! That's all I have to say. Digital Ocean is one of
the fastest cloud hosts around with their SSD backed virtual machines. To top it
 off their billing is a no-nonsense straight forward model. $5/mo for their
 lowest end server, with 1TB of included traffic. That's enough to scratch just
 about any itch you might have with the cloud.
