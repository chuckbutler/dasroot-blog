The Juju new workloads team has been hard at work to bring you Kubernetes,
deployed and modeled with Juju. There are two perspectives considered and
illustrated in this video: from a Consumer, and from a Developer.


Consumers: Get a reference architecture for Kubernetes (As of 1.0.0) and
deploy to any cloud - public or private.

Developers: Accellerate your development and verification cycle with Juju's
integration that lives in the Kubernetes git repository.
