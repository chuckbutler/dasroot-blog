I'm going to make the assumption you've seen Grandmas Boy. If you haven't, here's the trailer.

This movie is surprisingly packed with subtext about development, at least in my code centric mind. Without further adieu, I present to you - the things I learned about Software Development from Grandmas Boy.

If your company has a J.P. It's doing it wrong
----------------------------------------------

First lesson to learn : If your company has a JP - you're doing it wrong. When the entire basis of operation of your company funnels through a single developer: "The genius" syndrome will surely hamper productivity. JP was certainly impressive. 3d Modeling, Animation, Development, and running projects in parallel. All from the comfort of his binary clad office pounding out Aphex Twin.

(JP's inspiration music: right around the 5:00 mark)

If you've ever worked with a JP then you know - isolation is the worst possible thing that can happen to a developer. Coding is a very social activity, and when done right it has wave upon wave of active communication. Code Review, Push rejections, project discussions, and requirement changes. When you remove talent from the hive of creativity - you tend to end up with narrow program scope that fails to deliver on expectations. Nix the JP and hire a team Mr. Cheezle.

Encourage growth in team members
--------------------------------

An eager young tester approaches JP regarding a potential error. Characters in two parts of the game look similar and cause confusion. "Why don't we just render them a different color? Thats cheap, and effective in differentiating them" To which JP pulls an attitude fit (see: The genius syndrome in action) and ejects him from his office.

In any team environment - you should encourage growth in your team members by actively listening to their ideas. Consider everything! Fresh minds and new eyes over your progress can expose you to elements you had not considered, and may even open up avenues for undiscovered creativity. If you spend time repressing their ideas, its likely that they wont be willing to share future ideas. Should you approach a JP and receive the royal flush - do not self destruct like Caine. You're not a worthless asshole, and you dont deserve to die. Instead you should take pride in the fact that you discovered a problem and presented a solution.  You're a valuable member of any team - and should keep pride in your work.

Chores keep your mind prepared for change
-----------------------------------------

When Alex moves in with his Grandma, they immediately take advantage of having a strapping young lad in the house and put him to work with chores. While this vexes his usual lazy routine: it provides him a necessary break from worked scope. Testing video games all day and slinging code by night to write DEMONIC - his free time would have been on the decline.

As developers continue to grind away at problem solving, artists will stay up late at night to perfect the models they are working on - you're depriving your brain of much needed down time. Take a break from the computer. If your mind requires more activity than staring at the TV like a couch spud: read a book. Join a club. Do Chores!


Solutions can and will breed new problems
------------------------------------------

True to its word : Murphy's law can and will surface in your work day.

In an effort to catch up on the work time he was missing, Alex brings home a cable box to give the ladies something to do. The plan immediately backfires and they start an all night marathon of Antiques Road Show. #FAIL

When you introduce a change, and it causes a death roll: be prepared to think on your feet and adjust the course of action. It's usually a better option to push forward with fixes: you may not have an option to roll back. Alex experiences Murphy's law - and to regain footing he outsmarts his room mates with tickets to Antiques Road Show - and rushes them off to bed so they will be well rested for their big day.

Be prepared for someone to do your idea bigger and better
---------------------------------------------------------

As already mentioned, JP was a rockstar game developer. Programming video games since he was 13 he surely thought he had a corner on everything that was awesome... Until he shows up at Alex's house and discovers he had been working on Demonic. Showcasing futuristic mip mapping and better gameplay than what his games offered. While this can be a blow to the ego: reinvention has been the mother of creation for many years. If you build a search engine, someone will build it better. If you aggregate data from a single service, other services will aggregate from *ALL* services. It's a fact of life.

Don't have a robot
--------------------------

While it's a repeat statement: its probably the most important takeaway of all. Do not separate yourself from the group; especially if ti means that you do not attend out of work activities. The bonding and fun are important to everyone around you. It helps the entire team to unwind and share their experiences in a non threatening environment. Besides, you never know when you'll have fun by accident.
