[![Steel City Ruby Conference](/images/2012/Aug/scrc_logo.png)](http://www.steelcityrubyconference.org)

I had the pleasure of attending the first ever Steel City Ruby Conference. The focus and underlying theme was "Perfect for your first conference" -- and they did not fail to deliver. The talks were given in 45 minute blocks with 20 minute breaks. All the first time attendees were challenged to make 20 new acquantainces. Reinforcing that the subtext of the conference can hold many gems. The speaker lineup brought a multitde of topics ranging from why its important to consider [intersectional technology](http://www.slideshare.net/juliepagano/my-technology-will-be-intersectional-lightning2) to new goodies in how to power through your every day workflow with [Power Rake](http://www.confreaks.com/videos/988-goruco2012-power-rake).

[Julie Pagano](http://juliepagano.com) made some great conference [SketchNotes](http://juliepagano.com/blog/2012/08/05/steel-city-ruby-conf-2012-sketchnotes/)

* Getting the most out of a conference
* Thinking in Objects
* Anti-Opression
* Open Source: How to Give Back

And I was introduced to some new Pittsburgh area UserGroups. Like [SteelCloud](http://steelcloud.github.com/) and the [Ruby Brigade](http://pghrb.heroku.com/)

I think to sum it up, the organizers did an Amazing job at putting this conference together. The speakers brought their A-Game, and there were tons of lightning talks. One by my good friend [Jesse Dearing](https://speakerdeck.com/u/jessedearing/p/3-awesome-things-postgres-can-do)
