This weekend I tasked myself with "not working so hard". After having spent so much time at the grind I was ready for something fresh. The excitement of developing for fun has worn thin. I wasn't about to reach for the familiar MMO's. Those are literally a time-sink I have to battle myself away from every time I get started. Starcraft has gone to the hardcore players, and Diablo3 isn't here yet. What do I do?

  I hit my usual sources in Google Reader for gaming news, and ran across a gem. [Terraria](http://www.terraria.org) is an indie game published on steam for $10 USD. Its recipe is simple. Dig up materials, craft awesomeness, unlock NPC's, fight bad guys. You can play it at your own pace - it has some solid Multiplayer support (I'm running my own dedicated server at this point I'm so addicted already). Did I mention its addictive?

  You don't have to take my word for it. Check out the official gameplay trailer.

  If you want to setup your own linux dedicated server, read on!

  First and foremost, let me warn you. Mono is a hog - if you think you'll get away with running this on a bare-bones server, you might as well play on a public Terraria server or host it off your gaming rig. ~~Dedicated servers are going to require at BARE MINIMUM 1 gig of ram to run well. Mono will crash out with any less than this.~~ _note_ I've since discovered that when you use the TShock packaged bin without all of the debug hooks, you *can* run a dedicated server on an AWS micro instance - ~ 625 megs of ram. I have a server cap of 8 players and only use a medium sized world. World generation will take circa 10 minutes with this configuration - YMMV.

  Assuming you're using Ubuntu 11.10 - just run the following commands: (if you're running a 10.04 or prior you will need to compile mono from source)

  ` sudo apt-get install mono-complete`

  this takes about 5 minutes to fetch and install an on AWS Small instance

  Once you have completed this step - grab the TShock server binaries. TShock is a repack of the official Terraria server that comes with administration modifications, and thus ease the setup process.

[TShock Github Project Page](https://github.com/TShock/TShock/downloads)

  `wget https://github.com/TShock/TShock/tarball/master
   tar xvfz master
   cd TShock-TShock-ed6b95c && screen mono TerrariaServerBinaries\TerrariaServer.exe `

   _NEW!_ OR use this handy dandy script

   at this point you will need to create and name your new world, assign it a port, and setup is complete!
