You may have heard me mention something about "System Zoo" in the past. It's
been a long time to wait for this reveal, but the first episode of the SystemZoo
podcast has been published.

### What is System Zoo?

System Zoo is a loose organization of people who find it interesting to solve
problems with friends, rather than work in a vacuume. To get started all
that's required is an inquisitive mind, and the capacity to type in IRC. We hang
in #system-zoo on irc.freenode.net and sometimes hop on Mumble/Skype and start
pair programming.

Bi-Weekly (we hope!) conversations around interesting topics ranging from
infrastructure, culture, and programming to admin, design, and anything that
seems like a problem that would be more interesting to solve among friends.
