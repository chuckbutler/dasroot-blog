This year has been absolutely crazy. Never in my wildest dreams did I think I would come as far as I have.

I've always been a hobbyist engineer in the sense that I love hacking on unix systems, and tinkering with application code here and there for random web apps or scratch-your-own-itch applications. However this year was different: not only would I be toiling away building some great client sites; But I also attended 2 conferences, spoke at a school to a cache of eager engineers who wanted to know more about the technical landscape in Pittsburgh, helped found a MongoDB User Group with some co-workers and 10gen, Founded my own company, and stepped down from being middle management back into the engineering role I know and love.

In a single paragraph I just summed up the highlights of 2013.  Thats a great feeling, to know I've been so focused and articulate in my discipline.

I've gone over the soft skills and business landscape. Let's do something geeky and take a look at how my shell alises have evolved:

    #fix BZRs shit import
    export PYTHONPATH=/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-	packages:$PYTHONPATH

    #vim
    alias v='vim'
    alias vi='vim'

    #sublime's the new vim
    alias sub='sublime'

    #Setup git aliases
    alias g='git'
    alias gl='git l'
    alias glg='git log'
    alias gc='git commit'
    alias gcm='git commit -m'
    alias gs='git status'
    alias gtl='git tag -l -n'


    #setup ruby aliases
    alias bi='bundle install'
    alias be='bundle exec'

    #locomotive aliases
    alias bews='bundle exec wagon serve'
    alias bewp='bundle exec wagon push'
    alias bewg='bundle exec wagon generate'

    #rails aliases
    alias rs='bundle exec rails s'
    alias rg='bundle exec rails generate'
    alias rc='bundle exec rails c'

    #vagrant aliases
    alias vu='vagrant up'
    alias vp='vagrant provision'

Noteable new additions: Vagrant, LocomotiveWagon, and BZR. As you see I've been working fairly extensively in Chef, Vagrant, Juju, and working with a new Rails based CMS: [Locomotive CMS](http://www.locomotivecms.com)
